About Python Clicker:
        Python Clicker is a limited text terminal remake of the hit game Cookie Clicker within the Python coding language.
        
        As everything runs within the terminal, values only update once an action is preformed. 
        I assure you, however, that cookie production is calculated based on the passage of real world time.

List of Commands:
        '' (Empty Input) - Clicks Cookie
        '/s' or 'shop' - Enter shop
        '/st' or 'stats' - View statistics
