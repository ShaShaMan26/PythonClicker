About Python Clicker:
        Python Clicker is a limited text-based remake of the hit game Cookie Clicker within the Python coding language.
        
        Your goal is to cook as many cookies as you can.
        "Click" cookies to bake them and spend your cultivated cookies in the shop for upgrades that increase your yield of cookies per click or on buildings that generate cookies for you.
